#Super 50 Bros.
##CS50G Assignment 4
**Topics.** *Tile Maps, 2D Animation, Procedural Level Generation, and Platformer Physics*

The goal for this weeks assignment was to analyse the the distribution code for the game *Super 50 Bros* (a Mario clone) and implement the following features:

1. Modify the level generation algorithm so that the player will never spawn above a chasm.
2. Generate a random-coloured locked block and a key to unlock it. When the key has been picked up, the lock can be opened.
3. Opened the locked block will generate a goalpost & flag at the end of the level.
4. When the player touches the flag, the level is regenerated, and the player is respawned at the beginning (their score persists)

To see the distribution code for this project you can either download it here: https://cdn.cs50.net/games/2019/x/assignments/4/assignment4.zip , or you can view the initial commit for this repo.
